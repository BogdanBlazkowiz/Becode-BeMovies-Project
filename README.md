# Becode-BeMovies-Project

A movie carousel app, it queries the TheMovieDB for info about specified or simply latest movies.
Pure front-end, done using html, css and js with no frameworks.
Deployed on github pages for simple display of the features.
What you see here is my css, my partner for the group project did the js logic.
